## Reported Client Missing
*August 9th 2006*

Filed a missing persons repot for an Evan Cole around 9th Aug 2006, missing for 2 weeks at time of reporting, wants him found dead or alive.

After searching Coles house his journals suggest Clearshield might provide 'extra' services besides conventional health insurance. Upon contacting a Mr Greyson about Cole he became evasive after "cryptic advise" mentioned in Coles journal was mentioned.
