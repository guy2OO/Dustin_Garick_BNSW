## Reported Evan Cole Missing
*August 9th 2006*

Filed a missing persons repot for an Evan Cole around 9th Aug 2006, missing for 2 weeks at time of reporting, wants him found dead or alive. They sub-contracted [[Dustin Garick]] to find him.

After searching [[Evan Cole|Coles]] house his journals suggest Clearshield might provide 'extra' services besides conventional health insurance. Upon contacting a Mr Greyson about [[Evan Cole|Cole]] he became evasive after "cryptic advise" mentioned in [[Evan Cole|Coles]] journal was mentioned.
