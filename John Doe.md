Late in the night of the 11th (~23:00) an unknown individual broke into Johns house and attempted to assault him. John defended himself and killed the intruded during the struggle, in the process he destroyed some of the staircase in his house.
An employee of [[Phalanx Security]], Carlos, contact and employed Dustin Garick to investigate the break in at [[Jane Doe|Janes]] direction.

Upon examining the corpse it was found to a number of notable features,
- Missing eyes
- A 'northstar' tattoo, potentially NATO?
- Very flabby belly
- Major chest trauma, caused by John
- Has signs of already being autopsied

John claimed that the intruder had 'glowing orange eyes' and that he had encountered similar looking people during his service in Iraq near a temple. The intruder mentioned information that few people would know. John also mentioned he had a nightmare the night before the break in.

After noticing the signs of autopsy the [[Fred Flickinger|Mortician]] was questioned as no autopsy was meant to have occurred yet, he commented that this was a corpse that should have been in the morgue already.

Meet a medical student named [[Arawn Ellis]] outside morgue, she was present during embalming process on the 11th of August. Claims to have seen the body 'wake up' at ~17:00 during a blackout and heard it say something about 'being after someone', it had orange eyes upon 'waking up'. She claims the corpse was "possessed by Satan", corpse collapse again soon after.

Collected CCTV footage from 11-12th Aug from [[St Enochs Mortuary|Morgue]] to review and check if corpse moved.

After cleaning the autopsy room and finishing embalming Fred exits room.
