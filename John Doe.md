## Home Intruder
*August 12th 2006*

Late in the night of the 11th (~23:00) an unknown individual broke into Johns house and attempted to assault him. John defended himself and killed the intruded during the struggle, in the process he destroyed some of the staircase in his house.

Met up with John and after discussing the details of the break in accompanied him to the [[St Enochs Mortuary|Morgue]] to inspect the intruders body. Apparently the intruder told John to "Return what you have stolen!"

John claimed that the intruder had 'glowing orange eyes' and that he had encountered similar looking people during his service in Iraq near a temple. The intruder mentioned information that few people would know. John also mentioned he had a nightmare the night before the break in.

CCTC footage shows [[Fred Flickinger]] and [[Arawn Ellis]] embalming the corpse before Fred leaves ~17:04 and footage cuts as blackout hits; When footage resumes the corpse has moved and embalming fluid has been spilt. After cleaning the autopsy room and finishing embalming Fred exits room.
some of the room can be seen due to computer lights, the cabinet door opens at 21:00 and corpse exits cabinet and leaves room. Cabinet door closes on its own afterwards.
